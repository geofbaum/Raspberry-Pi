# Raspberry-Pi

Raspberry Pi Examples for sensors and other random doodles of my brain.

Most should work regardless of the version you are using but some might be relegated to what
you can use specifically in Python versions or the libraries that I may be interacting with.
Though I would hope that is not the case it is just forewarning to anyone delving into this repo
without looking at any requirements a specific file might need.

Hopefully this will include Python, C++, C#, Fortran, and other examples.
